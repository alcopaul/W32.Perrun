Perrun Virus Source Code
-----------------------------

i've written this when i was still a member of the rRlf ("hello rRlf guys!")... i decided to officially release the 
source in ebcvg #2...

history
--------
w32.hllp.jpginfector, as i named my lame proof-of-concept virus, was written on a fine afternoon of june 13, 2002 because
i just wanted to make a working proof of my article "Infecting Picture Files : A Desperate Approach"... that lame article
was written because of my song "sa iyong pagibig" dedicated to my partner... 
so the root of all the Perrun phenomenon was not the eagerness to achieve fame... the root is LOVE... "Hi Yelena!" :)

after the finishing touches to the binary, i submitted it to av sites... trend, symantec, mcafee.. (can't clearly remember
if i submitted it to avp, f-secure and sophos).... then i rested and ate my dinner.... i checked my mail again then
i recieved the remails from symantec and mcafee... i cleaned those excess trashes but luckily i forgot to delete 
mcafee's

When sending Virus Samples
		If you require further assistance with this virus or other
virus detection and/or cleaning please send the proposed sample(s) 
zipped
with the password "infected" (lower case) to one of the email addresses
listed below.

		Please note: We sometimes receive a file that is analysed as
cleaned, but actually find later that the file was infected when it 
left the
sender, and was cleaned along the line by mail gateway scanners, hence 
the
need for password-protected zip files.

		NOTE:  We try our very best to process the incoming samples
as soon as they arrive and hope to respond to customers on the same 
day.
However our official response time for virus samples is 48 hours 
(excluding
weekends).  This time may be extended due to samples which require 
further
analysis.

technical support and customer service, including:

*** i just wanted mcafee to see a description of it from their site... nothing more, nothing less.. :P

then two days after my submission of the virus to av sites, i checked out zdnet for some news.. then i found an
article that refers to Perrun.. "what a heck! that's my virus!", i thought... i tried my luck to see some of my
virus' articles in yahoo then i got a lot of hits...

can't please everybody.. there exist many criticisms about this virus... i read a lot of them... hehehe.. 
but i don't care..


final thought : this is a lame virus that "shook" the news for one time...

enjoy..

alcopaul

indirect thanks to murkry.. i borrowed the spawned host execution routine from his vb virus...
